# 🌍 Exploratory Analysis of Global Earthquake & Tsunami Events (2001–2022)

This project performs an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of global earthquake and tsunami events from **2001 to 2022**.  
It aims to uncover **patterns, trends, correlations, and potential seismic indicators** associated with tsunami generation.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis cause significant global impact.  
Understanding seismic behavior helps improve **early warning systems**, **risk management**, and **disaster preparedness**.

This analysis explores:
- Global distribution of earthquakes
- Magnitude–depth relationships
- Temporal patterns (yearly/monthly)
- Correlations between seismic parameters
- Characteristics of tsunami vs. non-tsunami earthquakes
## 🚀 Key Analyses & Visualizations

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- Removed null values and duplicates  
- Converted date/time formats  
- Encoded tsunami indicators  

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Global event frequency trends (2001–2022)  
- Distribution by magnitude, depth, and location  
- Yearly and monthly earthquake counts  
- Correlation analysis among numeric variables  
- Comparison of **tsunami vs. non-tsunami** earthquakes  

### 3. **Visual Insights**
- Heatmaps of magnitude–depth correlation  
- World maps showing epicenter distribution  
- Boxplots and histograms for seismic parameters  
- Line charts for yearly/temporal trends
